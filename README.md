# Welcome

## About me:

I'm an Endpoint Engineer, a certified Ivanti Engineer, and currently a student a Western Governors University focusing in Cyber Security. I've started this Gitbook after coming across and using Dave Segura's absolutely wonderful tool, **OSDBuilder.** My goal is for this to serve as a means to document and share things I come across in my time in IT. 

## Current Projects

My current project involves redesigning our current Ivanti EPM Provisioning workflow to better serve our International users.
